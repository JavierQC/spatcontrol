- no llh to be compared with different Delta as S has no inverse, it is ok to get a likelihood for various
values of u with one Q but not compare the likelihood a u for various Q. For this we need to calculate pi(u|y) what I did and found no identifiability, at least with previous subset
- That also means to me that the sampling we do in the metropolis hasting is worthless as 
if Q is the precision matrix Q*u ~N(0,I) but no inverse for Q, no possible sampling.

- formula equivalent to V(x)=E(1/n * sum(x-mu)^2) to get a variance matrix or better a precision matrix ?

- proposition of my model
